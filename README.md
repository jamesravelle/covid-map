# How to use this app:

Select a date from the date picker. Click submit to see Covid-19 deaths and cases for that day. 
Note that the maximum date is from 2 days ago, when the data was most recently updated. 
The map and bar chart are color coded by deaths. Clicking a state will scroll to that state's data in the table, which contains total daily deaths/cases and total deaths/cases to the date selected. Total deaths/cases for all states on the date selected display to the right of the date picker.

Data is collected from the [CDC Covid Data API](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36/data)
